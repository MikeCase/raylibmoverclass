# What is it

This is an entity mover class in raylib that I've been messing around with to learn C/C++.
It's not extremely advanced but currently holds a few basic movements.

# How does it work.

You would use this as a baseclass to build an entity with movement. A player character, and enemy character etc.. You would create your class and inherit from the Mover baseclass. An example is provided of a player class that inherits from the Mover baseclass. There are four different movement styles currently. I plan on adding different styles for different 2d game styles.


# How do I use it?

There's an example provided.

I will update this with quickstart instructions soon.
